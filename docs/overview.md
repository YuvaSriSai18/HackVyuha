## ðŸ“˜ **Project Outline: ResearchChain â€“ A Decentralized Academic Publishing Platform**


### ðŸ”¹ **1. Project Title**

**ResearchChain** â€“ A Decentralized, Transparent, and Reward-Based Academic Publishing Ecosystem

---

### ðŸ”¹ **2. Objective**

To revolutionize academic publishing by eliminating intermediaries, ensuring author ownership, and incentivizing contributions through blockchain, AI, and decentralized technologies.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **3. Problem Statement**

Current academic publishing is slow, expensive, and controlled by centralized entities. Authors lack ownership, peer reviewers are unrewarded, and global accessibility is restricted due to paywalls.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **4. Proposed Solution**

Develop a decentralized platform using **Polygon blockchain**, **Thirdweb**, and **IPFS**, combined with **AI tools** to:

* Let authors publish papers directly.
* Store papers permanently.
* Provide peer-review incentives.
* Ensure transparent citation and access tracking.
* Reward all contributors with tokens and reputation.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **5. Key Features**

* Blockchain-based paper publishing and timestamping.
* AI tools for plagiarism detection, summarization, and keyword extraction.
* Decentralized peer-review with smart contract-based incentives.
* Open-access and paywall-free global reach.
* Immutable records for citations and reviews.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **6. Tech Stack**

* **Frontend**: React JS, Tailwind CSS, Thirdweb SDK
* **Blockchain**: Polygon (Mumbai/Mainnet), Solidity Smart Contracts
* **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask
* **Storage**: IPFS/Filecoin
* **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
* **Database (for auxiliary data)**: MongoDB
* **AI Modules**: GPT-based services for summarization, keyword extraction, plagiarism checking

---

### ðŸ”¹ **7. System Architecture Overview**

1. **User Auth via Wallet (MetaMask)**
2. **Form Submission (Paper Upload)**
3. **AI Validation**
4. **IPFS + Blockchain Storage**
5. **Smart Contract Execution (Ownership & Access)**
6. **Peer Review & Token Rewards**
7. **Access/Citation Tracking**
8. **Collaboration Marketplace**

---

### ðŸ”¹ **8. Modules Breakdown**

* **Author Dashboard**
* **Reviewer Dashboard**
* **Reader/Citation Tracker**
* **AI Validation Engine**
* **Collaboration and Funding Board**
* **Token Reward and Reputation Engine**

---

### ðŸ”¹ **9. Expected Impact**

* Democratizes academic research.
* Rewards every meaningful contributor.
* Enables global accessibility and collaboration.
* Ensures ownership, transparency, and trust.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **10. Scalability**

* Expand to support multiple research domains.
* Integrate academic identity systems (like ORCID).
* Launch DAO governance for decision-making.
* Add grant funding via crypto investments.
