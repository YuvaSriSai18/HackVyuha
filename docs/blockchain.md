## 🔗 Blockchain Components to Implement

### 1. **Smart Contracts**

These will be written in **Solidity** and deployed on **Polygon** using **Thirdweb**:

* **Paper Metadata Contract**

  * Stores metadata (title, abstract, author addresses, keywords, etc.)
  * Links to the IPFS hash of the research paper
  * Stores access type (open/paid/hybrid)

* **Revenue Sharing Contract**

  * Automatically splits revenue from downloads or citations
  * Payments sent in platform tokens or MATIC
  * Can handle multiple authors (percent-based logic)

* **Citation Tracking Contract**

  * Logs citations and paper references on-chain
  * Used to update the author's reputation and rewards

* **Peer Review Contract**

  * Records reviews submitted by peers
  * Validates reviewer identities and timestamps reviews
  * Rewards reviewers with tokens

* **Collaboration Contract**

  * Allows users to post and fund research proposals
  * Manages milestone-based funding via escrow system
  * Disburses tokens when conditions are met

* **Access Control Contract**

  * Manages read/write/download access
  * Validates paid access or open-access rights before unlocking IPFS links

* **Token Contract (ERC-20)**

  * Native utility token for the platform (e.g., RECHAIN)
  * Used for payments, rewards, staking, and access
  * Integrated into the revenue-sharing, collaboration, and reputation systems

### 2. **IPFS / Filecoin Integration**

* Store full research papers and documents on **IPFS**
* Upload handled via `web3.storage` or **Thirdweb's storage SDK**
* Save the returned IPFS CID in the **PaperMetadataContract**

---

### 3. **Thirdweb Integration**

* Use **Thirdweb SDK** to:

  * Interact with smart contracts (read/write)
  * Deploy and manage contracts from the frontend
  * Connect users via **MetaMask** for authentication
  * Handle payments and token transactions

---

### 4. **Polygon Blockchain**

* **Mumbai Testnet** for testing and development
* **Polygon Mainnet** for final deployment

  * Fast and cost-effective transactions
  * Compatible with Ethereum tooling and wallets

---

### 5. **Wallet Integration**

* Use **MetaMask** for user sign-in and transaction approval
* Authenticate and assign roles (Author, Reviewer, Reader) based on wallet address

---

### 6. **Gas Fee Abstraction (Optional)**

* Integrate **gasless transactions** using Thirdweb’s **Relayer API** or Biconomy
* Make it easier for non-technical users to interact with the blockchain

### 🔗 Blockchain Implementation Modules

---

#### **1. Paper Metadata Contract**

* ✅ First contract to implement (foundation of paper publishing)
* Stores:

  * Paper title, abstract, keywords
  * Author wallet addresses
  * IPFS hash (document storage link)
  * Access type: `open`, `paid`, or `hybrid`

---

#### **2. Access Control Contract**

* 🛡️ Controls who can read or download papers
* Checks:

  * If user is the author
  * If paper is free
  * If user paid for access
* Grants access by revealing IPFS URL or decryption key

---

#### **3. Token Contract (ERC-20)**

* 💰 Deploy a native platform token (e.g., `RECHAIN`)
* Use:

  * For payments (paid access, peer review rewards)
  * Revenue splits
  * Reputation boosts / staking
* Required for integration in upcoming modules

---

#### **4. Revenue Sharing Contract**

* 💸 Activated when a user pays for access
* Automatically splits revenue to:

  * Primary author
  * Co-authors
  * Platform (optional fee)
* Payments in RECHAIN or MATIC

---

#### **5. Peer Review Contract**

* 🧠 Enables decentralized peer reviewing
* Reviewers can:

  * Submit anonymous or open reviews
  * Sign review with their wallet
* Reviewers are rewarded with tokens upon approval

---

#### **6. Citation Tracking Contract**

* 🔗 Records references and citation relationships between papers
* Updates:

  * Citation count
  * Author reputation
  * Token-based citation reward (optional)

---

#### **7. Collaboration Contract**

* 🤝 Facilitates research proposals and joint projects
* Allows:

  * Posting funding requests
  * Backers to contribute tokens
* Funds are locked in an escrow and released by milestones

---

> ✅ **Suggested Order of Implementation:**

1. `TokenContract`
2. `PaperMetadataContract`
3. `AccessControlContract`
4. `RevenueSharingContract`
5. `PeerReviewContract`
6. `CitationTrackingContract`
7. `CollaborationContract`
